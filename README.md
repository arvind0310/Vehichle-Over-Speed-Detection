# Vehichle-Over-Speed-Detection


In many parts of the highway road, accidents found a major social problem. There are
several reasons to why vehicle accidents. Most of accidents on the highway road cause by
high speed driving. Some highway road has sign boards signifying maximum speed limit
permitted while driving such as 100 km/h for the driver’s safety, but some people does not
follow speed limit. Therefore, the vehicles keep a constant speed within the speed limit over
a particular area
In this Project, speed detection system for vehicles is proposed. This system provides very
effective in detection of over speed driving. This circuit is mainly consists of Arduino UNO,
two IR sensors, 1602A LCD. When a vehicle is passing between the first and second sensors,
the two sensors sense the object and then microcontroller program will start counting.
When it passes cross the second sensor the microcontroller will stop counting and calculate
the speed as kilometer per hour. If the car’s speed is over speed(100 km/h). Then,
LCD displays the speed of vehicles. This system is to improve a device that detects over
speeding of vehicle, gives warning using alarm and display vehicle’s speed in LCD.
